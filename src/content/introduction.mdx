To understand how Armitage works, we need to dive onto the mechanics of Sourcecred, a project that once had support from Protocol Labs that is now unfortunately archived.
Althought the project is archived, we don't think its impact needs to stop, and with Armitage, we hope to ignite interest into new people on the industry, both to revive Sourcecred and to engage new conversations about open source governance and autonomous organizations.
We are also proudly inspired by the works of the Token Engineering Academy, and the Token Engineering commons, you should definetely check them out!

> If you haven't ever heard about `sourcecred` before, we highly recommend that you watch Dandelion's 20 minute talk (+Qs) from SustainWeb3 to get some familiarity with the project.

There will also be some math, but you should be able to get a solid intution on this if you are comfortable talking about graphs as a set of nodes and edges, where the edges connect nodes, can be directed and can have weights. We will also briefly touch upon the PageRank algorithm, which computes the "importance" of nodes in a graph based on the "importance" of nodes connected to it.

## The high-level overview

Sourcecred main purpose is to gather information from various sources (in our case github), and build a structure that can represent importance between objects, which can later be translated by how a group of objects is important compared to others.
More directly speaking, sourcecred takes information about contributions and generates what we call a `contribution-graph`, with this first part of the article, we aim to explain what that graph is and where it comes from.
After exploring the structure called `contribution-graph`, we will then discuss how Sourcecred runs the CredRank algorithm to generate cred scores, what we call in Armitage as contribution scores.

If you have already stumbled upon Armitage roadmap, you probably saw that we also have plans to enable a feature that distributes "points" based on contribution scores, this, on the Sourcecred world, was called Cred distribution, which was generated and calculated from the graph of cred scores periodically as a stream of rewards. We have slightly different plans on how to utilize this functionality in Armitage, but this is for another deeper article!

### Components of contributions in Sourcecred

We will now outline how contribution data is gathered and structured, and how it is transformed into the exact amounts of cred and grain that are calculated.

Sourcecred first generates a contribution graph from the input data, in this graph, a node is a contributor or contribution, and an edge represents some sort of connection between the nodes.
These "connections" are intended to include all possible ways in which a contribution or contributor on a platform can express dependencies, recognition or flows of value.
An example of such connection, would be liking or merging a PR on Github.

It's worth pausing for a moment to make a distinction. In graph theory, a weighted graph has weights on the edges, whereas the Sourcecred `contribution graph` has weights on both edges and nodes, together with some extra features.


#### Nodes

Contributions are represented as nodes in the graph and are given addresses to identify them uniquely. These addresses include a prefix, which takes the form: `[organization making the plugin that generates the node] + [name of the plugin] + [type of contribution]`
Contributors are also represented as nodes in the graph. These nodes are similarly prefixed and connected to contributions with directed edges.
For example, if an author node creates an issue, the author node gets an incoming edge from the issue node. Or if an author of a pull request mentions another contributor on the PR, the PR creates an outbound edge coming from the author.


#### Weights

Both nodes and edges have weights, and an edge object in the SourceCred implementation can have forward and backward weight. We'll get into what these weights mean shortly, but, for now, it's worth noting that these weights can easily be set by address prefix.
Additionally, an edge can start and end on the same node (loops), which could be relevant when a piece of content is edited or a contribution references itself.

#### Timestamps

Because edges are associated with actions or events, they will always have a timestamp that corresponds to when the action or event occurred.
Nodes don't need a timestamp since the edge will carry information about the moment of the contribution.

> Now we know about the components of the contribution graph, their properties, and how they fit together. Now let's cover how they're generated.


### Generating the contribution graph

Because sourcecred incorporate data from all sorts of contributions and outputs a single directed graph with weights (for nodes and edges), ther eneeds to be a way
to compare actions quantitatively (e.g., authoring a Github issue vs responding or referencing it). To accomplish this, there's a set of constants that determine weights for nodes and edges.
For an example set of constants, see the below figure:

> Prob better to take an updated screenshot showing the actuall current sliders for github plugin

**Additionally, note that Armitage plans to offer all these parameters to be scoped to a community through governance features. Currently, it only calculate contribution scores using the default parameters as shown on the picture above.**
With the possibility of changing the default parameters comes the opportunity for not only the maintainer, but if desired, the community that supports a project to set and control the parameters. 
Armitage adopts several sourcecred stances, and aims to provide community control, keeping humans in the loop, both for gaming mitigation and general adaptability. At the bottom line, it's important to keep the humans in control because good governance technology only works with the consent of the governed.

At this point, we've got data from all our sources combined in one directed graph, where contributions and contributors are nodes, and interactions and connections between nodes are edges. Both nodes and edges have a relative weight based on parameters the community or the maintainer has set, and were ready to run the CredRank algorithm on the graph.

### Sourcecred CredRAnk algorithm

The goal of CredRank is to calculate the relative importance of nodes based on our contribution graph, specifically the weights of the nodes and edges.
We'll also cover some intermediate calculations shown in the figure below, which illustrates an expanded overview of SourceCred.
In particular, it includes adding some nodes for cred calculation and converting weights in our contribution graph to probabilities, in order to eventually run PageRank, which uses a Markov chain (a set of states with probabilities describing the likelihood of transitioning between states)

Before going into those details, let's motivate the role of probabilities in calculating cred.

#### Contribution importance as a stationary distribution

Starting from our contribution graph, we want to calculate our contribution scores (cred), which is the relative importance of nodes compared to each other. 
We start with the intuition that any contribution's importance is explicitly validated by future contributions, and the strenght of that validation is greater if it comes from contributions that are themselves more significant.
If you have ever heard of RPGF (Retroactive Public Good Funding) you will immediately start noticing its similarities and how Sourcecred is a powerful tool to measure contributions.

As a _metaphor_, we can visualize cred flowing through the graph as water flowing through a watershed ecosystem of creeks, springs and ponds:

- Water bubbles up at certain locations where there are springs feeding ponds. These correspond to actions that mint contribution scores (cred).
- Water flows through streams connecting ponds. The flow to downstream nodes is proportional to the strength of the connection.
- Additionally, water from all of these ponds seeps into the ground, replenishing the springs and providing a closed loop.
- Finally, the equilibrium water level in each pond is proportional to the relative importance of that node.

## What to expect from here on out

What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like **bold text**, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, _and even italics_.

It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:

1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.
2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.

Now we're going to try out another header style.

### Typography should be easy

So that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.

Something a wise person once told me about typography is:

> Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.

It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:

<Image
  src="/images/blog/blog-post-4.jpg"
  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

Now I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:

- So here is the first item in this list.
- In this example we're keeping the items short.
- Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.

And that's the end of this section.

## What if we stack headings?

### We should make sure that looks good, too.

Sometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.

### When a heading comes after a paragraph …

When a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.

- **I often do this thing where list items have headings.**

  For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.

  I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.

- **Since this is a list, I need at least two items.**

  I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.

- **It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.**

  I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it.

After this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.

## Code should look okay by default.

I think most people are going to use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) or [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) or something if they want to style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look _okay_ out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.

Here's what a default `tailwind.config.js` file looks like at the time of writing:

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Hopefully that looks good enough to you.

### What about nested lists?

Nested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.

1.  **Nested lists are rarely a good idea.**
    - You might feel like you are being really "organized" or something but you are just creating a gross shape on the screen that is hard to read.
    - Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.
    - Nesting tons of folders in your source code is also not helpful.
2.  **Since we need to have more items, here's another one.**
    - I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels deep.
    - Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.
    - If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.
3.  **Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.**
    - Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.
    - Nobody wants to look at this.
    - I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.

The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that `<li>` elements aren't given a child `<p>` tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.

- **For example, here's another nested list.**

  But this time with a second paragraph.

  - These list items won't have `<p>` tags
  - Because they are only one line each

- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**

  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.

  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `<p>` tag.

    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.

  - Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.

- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?

And finally a sentence to close off this section.

## There are other elements we need to style

I almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.

We even included table styles, check it out:

| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Bret "The Hitman" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |
| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |
| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |
| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |
| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |

We also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `<span>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.

### Sometimes I even use `code` in headings

Even though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard time making it look good. This _"wrap the code blocks in backticks"_ trick works pretty well though really.

Another thing I've done in the past is put a `code` tag inside of a link, like if I wanted to tell you about the [`tailwindcss/docs`](https://github.com/tailwindcss/docs) repository. I don't love that there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth the madness it would require to avoid it.

#### We haven't used an `h4` yet

But now we have. Please don't use `h5` or `h6` in your content, Medium only supports two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered using a `before` pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an `h5` or `h6`.

We don't style them at all out of the box because `h4` elements are already so small that they are the same size as the body copy. What are we supposed to do with an `h5`, make it _smaller_ than the body copy? No thanks.

### We still need to think about stacked headings though.

#### Let's make sure we don't screw that up with `h4` elements, either.

Phew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they look pretty good.

Let's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.

What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final sentence can't hurt.

## GitHub Flavored Markdown

I've also added support for GitHub Flavored Mardown using `remark-gfm`.

With `remark-gfm`, we get a few extra features in our markdown. Example: autolink literals.

A link like www.example.com or https://example.com would automatically be converted into an `a` tag.

This works for email links too: contact@example.com.
